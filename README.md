Lab 2 Exam: Network Topology with RIP and OSPF Configuration
Objective
Set up and configure a network topology using RIP and OSPF routing protocols in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Topology Design
10-12 computers distributed across two LANs.
Two or more switches.
Two routers connected via a WAN link.
Each computer named in the format PC_<RollNumber> (e.g., PC_123).
IP Addressing
Each computer is assigned an IP address using the last three digits of the roll number.
LAN 1: 192.168.1.0/24
LAN 2: 192.168.2.0/24
Routing Protocols
Router 1: RIP v1
Router 2: OSPF
Steps
Add devices and create the network connections.
Assign IP addresses to all computers based on the format provided.
Configure RIP on Router 1 and OSPF on Router 2.
Verify communication between LANs via simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Files Included
